About me
--------
I am a __University Professor__ (tenured) for __Natural Language Understanding__ (Computational Linguistics) at the Faculty of Applied Computer Science at the __University of Augsburg__ (start date: June 1, 2023).

Before that, I was a __Senior Expert__ working on Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics at the [Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.bosch-ai.com/).

I am currently the vice president of the [German Society for Computational Linguistics](https://gscl.org/en) (GSCL), the scientific association in the German-speaking countries and regions for research, teaching and professional work in natural language processing.

Research Interests
------------------

* Computational Syntax and Semantics
* Discourse Processing
* Text Mining / Information Extraction
* Linguistic Annotation
* Deep Learning

I am interested in understanding and modeling interactions at the syntax-semantics interface, taking into account influences of discourse and pragmatics. Most of my past research is about the computational modeling of aspect and genericity. More details [here](https://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/projects/sitent/page.php). I am currently also interested in text mining for scientific text, syntactic and semantic parsing, and uncertainty in the context of deep learning for NLP.



PhD Students
------------

* Valentin Knappich (2023-), document-level processing of patent text, co-supervised with Simon Razniewski (Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence)
* Timo Schrader (2023-), temporal processing of text, co-supervised with Lukas Lange and Simon Razniewski (Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence)
* Wei Zhou (2023-), document-level modeling of text, co-supervised with Heike Adel and Mohsen Mesgar (Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence)

I also work(ed) very closely with the following PhD students:

* [Sophie Henning](https://sophiehenning.github.io/) (2021-), uncertainty modeling and confidence estimation for deep learning in NLP, co-supervised with Alexander Fraser (LMU Munich)
* [Stefan Grünewald](https://stgrue.net/) (2019-2023), dependency-parsing based approaches to open information extraction from scientitic text, co-supervised with Jonas Kuhn (University of Stuttgart)
* [Subhash Pujari Chandra](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Pda-ntQAAAAJ&hl=en) (2019-2023), text mining from patents, co-supervised with Michael Gertz (Heidelberg University) and Jannik Strötgen
