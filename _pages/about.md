About me
--------
I am a __Lead Research Scientist__ working on Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics at the [Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.bosch-ai.com/). I am __Activity Manager__ for the _Robust Language Processing_ research activity.

I am currently the vice president of the [German Society for Computational Linguistics](https://gscl.org/en) (GSCL), the scientific association in the German-speaking countries and regions for research, teaching and professional work in natural language processing.

Research Interests
------------------

* Computational Syntax and Semantics
* Discourse Processing
* Text Mining / Information Extraction
* Linguistic Annotation
* Deep Learning

I am interested in understanding and modeling interactions at the syntax-semantics interface, taking into account influences of discourse and pragmatics. Most of my past research is about the computational modeling of aspect and genericity. More details [here](https://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/projects/sitent/page.php). I am currently also interested in text mining for scientific text, syntactic and semantic parsing, and uncertainty in the context of deep learning for NLP.



PhD Students
------------

In case you're wondering ... I am not a university professor but I am lucky to work very closely with several very talented PhD students at our industrial research lab.

* Sophie Henning (2021-), uncertainty modeling and confidence estimation for deep learning in NLP, co-supervised with Alexander Fraser (LMU Munich)
* [Stefan Grünewald](https://stgrue.net/) (2019-), dependency-parsing based approaches to open information extraction from scientitic text, co-supervised with Jonas Kuhn (University of Stuttgart)
* [Subhash Pujari Chandra](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Pda-ntQAAAAJ&hl=en) (2019-), text mining from patents, co-supervised with Michael Gertz (Heidelberg University) and Jannik Strötgen
