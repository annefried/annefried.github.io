About me
--------
I am a __University Professor__ (tenured) for __Natural Language Understanding__ (Computational Linguistics) at the Faculty of Applied Computer Science at the __University of Augsburg__.
Find more about Human Language Technology in Augsburg [here](https://hlt-augsburg.github.io/).

Before that, I was a __Senior Expert__ working on Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics at the [Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.bosch-ai.com/).

I am currently the president of the [German Society for Computational Linguistics](https://gscl.org/en) (GSCL), the scientific association in the German-speaking countries and regions for research, teaching and professional work in natural language processing.

Research Interests
------------------

* Computational Syntax and Semantics
* Discourse Processing
* Text Mining / Information Extraction
* Linguistic Annotation
* Deep Learning

I am interested in understanding and modeling interactions at the syntax-semantics interface, taking into account influences of discourse and pragmatics. Most of my past research is about the computational modeling of aspect and genericity. More details [here](https://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/projects/sitent/page.php). I am currently also interested in text mining for scientific text, syntactic and semantic parsing, and uncertainty in the context of deep learning for NLP.
