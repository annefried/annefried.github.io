_This relates to PhD defenses in computer science / computational linguistics in Germany! The customs of your department/country/scientific discipline may differ._

Towards the end of their PhD journey, PhD students are experts on their research topic and probably already well acquainted with how to create posters about their research papers and with how to give an effective research talk that mostly covers one topic. What they have often rarely done, however, is giving a coherent talk summarizing all of their contributions. Moreover, PhD defense talks constitute a talk genre in their own, differing from both conference presentations and typical conference keynotes or invited talks. To provide some guidances, I am summarizing some expectations and tips in this post.

## Key Objectives

The objective of a conference paper talk is make the audience curious about your work. The objective of an invited talk or a keynote are (in my opinion) to educate and entertain. So what is the goal of a PhD defense? Do you have to specifically defend what you've worked on? The ideas that you proposed? Yes and no. Plus, in natural language processing (NLP) or computer science (CS) more broadly, most content of your dissertation will have been peer-reviewed before publication at conferences or in journals beforehand, so it is unlikely that this part will be questioned. The goal is somewhat broader.

* **Demonstrate Experience:** Your goal is to prove that you have become a competent and independent researcher in your field.

* **Demonstrate Awareness of Research Landscape:** Often, PhD defense presentations only focus on the research bits conducted by the PhD candidate. Of course, that is an important part, but it is also important to precisely locate that bit in the research landscape. Do not forget to explain what the state of the art was when you started each bit of research and what the gap was that your approach/method/idea/results solve.

* **Present your work:** Typically, a PhD defense is between 30 and 60 minutes, so naturally, there is not sufficient time to explain everything you have worked on. Of course, you need to give an overview, but ideally, choose two publications (three if your PhD defense is a bit longer) for which you provide a deep dive.


## Audience

In contrast to the conference presentation that you have probably given, the audience of your defense typically has a somewhat broader scientific background. This means that your presentation should explain everything in a way that at least every committee member can make sense of it. The examiners of your written thesis will have read your dissertation in detail. However, there are likely additional examiners for the oral exam which may not have read the dissertation in detail. Plus, you also want to make the rest of the audience happy. So explain everything in accessible and general terms, but be specific and go a bit more into detail when you deep-dive into those 2-3 papers.


## Structure

* Start with explanations of the topic that you trying to solve, and the respective state-of-the-art.
* What is the motivation for working on this topic? Which problems will it solve? Think broadly. What are relationships to established subfields or research areas in NLP/CL?
* Create a slide that visualizes which topics/problems you have worked on and how they relate. In the image below, you can see examples from my own defense and from Stefan Grünewald's (copyright for his slide: him and Bosch).
