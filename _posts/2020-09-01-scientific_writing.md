An [overview](https://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2011/08/punctuating-around-quotation-marks.html) of where to put quotation marks in English.

[This page](http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/essays/abstract.html) provides a nice summary of how to write good abstracts for your research papers.

I highly recommend [this book](https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/q0232) on science research writing for non-native speakers of English as a must-read for PhD students in our field.

[Scientifc Writing Cheat Sheet + Exercises (PDF)], developed for PhD students, but certainly also useful for Bachelor/Master students.
