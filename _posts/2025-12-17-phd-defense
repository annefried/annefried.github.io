Towards the end of their PhD journey, PhD students are experts on their research topic and probably already well acquainted with how to create posters about their research papers and with how to give an effective research talk that mostly covers one topic. What they have often rarely done, however, is giving a coherent talk summarizing all of their contributions. Moreover, PhD defense talks constitute a talk genre in their own, differing from both conference presentations and typical conference keynotes or invited talks.

The objective of a conference paper talk is make the audience curious about your work. The objective of an invited talk or a keynote are (in my opinion) to educate and entertain.
