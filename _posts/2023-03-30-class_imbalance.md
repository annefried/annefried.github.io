Sophie Henning (PhD student at the Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence (BCAI)) and I got invited to write a blogpost for AIhub about our EACL 2023 paper on methods for addressing class imbalance in DL-based NLP. If you ever encountered the problem of your classifier only paying attention to the majority classes and wondered what to do about this, this article is for you. :)
